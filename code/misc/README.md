The contents of this folder: 

topic_models/ Topic modeling was applied to the documents, but this was done as an experiment quite awhile back, and the code is not really clean, so CLEAN is appended to all document names. This has lower priority. 

text_encodings/ Code that was mostly foudn on the web, to test character encodings of the files... This was done when trying to figure out exactly what to do with accents.
