network_estimation/ Code for performing network estimation. 

network_processing/ Code for converting network estimation results into web-interface stuff. This might not belong in the ODNB folder, since it is not ODNB specific, but I suppose it depends on where you want to take the code. 

text_processing/ Code for converting ODNB articles into document-count matrices. 

unsorted_code/ There isn't anything in here that is essential to performing the previous tasks. These contain either older versions of things I've tried, miscellaneous experimental tasks, or just formatting data in certain ways. I'll process these last.
